C++ Library Skeleton
====================

This is a skeleton project for a C++ library. There's really nothing here
other than the build, some stub files, Eclipse stuff and some infrastructure...

Adapting For Your Project
-------------------------

A few things will need to be changed in the Makefile and package.fig, and the
directory api/ccs will need to be renamed.
